		<p>
			My name is Kendall Roberts. I am from <span>Stockton Mo</span>, as in the Lake town. 
			I ran track and played football in high school. I have a couple of state medals that my relay team 
			and I have achieved. <ul></ul> 
			I am interested in computer science because I have several friends who also 
			do some things in the computer science field. 
			I also know that the job market for computer science and software development is good and 
			constantly growing so 
			I feel getting a job anywhere in the U.S. is very much achievable. <ul></ul>
			Getting a job anywhere in the United States is important to me because I don't want to live
			in Missouri. I dream of moving to Oregon , or one of the western states and continuing my life and 
			career there. <ul></ul>
			I have a dog if you like dogs he is a <span>Blue Heeler</span> and he is very hyper, but he is fun. 
			I still live in Stockton with my cousin, and I make the morning commute 3 days a week.
