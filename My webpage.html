			<section>My name is Kendall Roberts. I am from <span>Stockton Mo</span>, as in the Lake town. 
				I ran track and played football in high school. I have a couple of state medals that my relay team 
				and I have achieved. <br> 
			</section> <ul></ul>
			<sectiion>I am interested in computer science because I have several friends who also 
				do some things in the computer science field. 
				I also know that the job market for computer science and software development is good and 
				constantly growing so 
				I feel getting a job anywhere in the U.S. is very much achievable. <br>
			</sectiion> <ul></ul>
			<section>Getting a job anywhere in the United States is important to me because I don't want to live
				in Missouri. I dream of moving to Oregon , or one of the western states and continuing my life and 
				career there. <br>
			</section><ul></ul>
			<section>I have a dog if you like dogs he is a <span>Blue Heeler</span> and he is very hyper, but he is fun. 
				I still live in Stockton with my cousin, and I make the morning commute 3 days a week.
