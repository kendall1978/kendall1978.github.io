00:01.00 --> 00:004.000 
We observe today

(00:04.000 - 00:06.000) not a victory of party,

(00:06.000 - 00:10.000) but a celebration of freedom –

(00:10.000 - 00:12.000) symbolizing an end,

(00:12.000 - 00:15.000) as well as a beginning –

(00:15.000 - 00:17.000) signifying renewal,

(00:17.000 - 00:19.000) as well as change.

(00:19.000 - 00:22.000) For I have sworn before you

(00:22.000 - 00:24.000) and Almighty God

(00:24.000 - 00:27.000) the same solemn oath

(00:27.000 - 00:30.000) our forebears prescribed

(00:30.000 - 00:33.000) nearly a century and three-quarters ago
