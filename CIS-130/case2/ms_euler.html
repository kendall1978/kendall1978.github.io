            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

            <p>
            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
            <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
            he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
            Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
            and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
            Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
            publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His 
            influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
            
            He is perhaps best known for his research into 
            mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
            <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, 
            remained a standard textbook in the field for 
            well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
            he wrote 
            <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
            giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
            physical theories of the time.
            
            One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
            copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
            as e and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
            in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
            leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
            certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

        <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>
            
        <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:
            
            <code>cos(<var>x</var>)+<var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>)=<var>e</var><sup><var>xi</var></sup></code>
            
            which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
            complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
            equation, it's easy to derive the identity:
            
            <code><var>e</var><sup><var>&pi;</var><var>i</var></sup>+1=0</code>
            
            which relates the fundamental constants: 
            0, 1, <var>&pi;</var>, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
            elegant statement. A poll of readers 
            conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
            magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
            most beautiful theorem in the history of 
            mathematics.
